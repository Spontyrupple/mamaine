Prenatal - 5,CBPS: Lactation and Perinatal Support,Pacific Islander Health Board of  Washington,"The Pacific Islander community faces numerous barriers when it comes to accessing prenatal care. Together with American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic, NHPI mothers were 40% less likely than White non-Hispanic mothers to receive early and adequate prenatal care. Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander mothers were also found to have high smoking rates while pregnant; are between 4 and 8 times more likely to be obese while experiencing pregnancy; and are 2.3 to 3.3 times more likely to have any hypertension during pregnancy. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders also experience socioeconomic burdens, with about one in seven being uninsured and lacking access to preventative healthcare programs and interventions. Among specific NHPI ethnic groups, Tongans, Marshallese, Fijians, and CHamorus are less likely to be insured than the average. Community members expressed an immediate need to include postpartum education during pregnancy and postpartum support after birth. Postpartum depression and exhaustion were among the most common health issues experienced upon giving birth, and many community members expressed that the length and severity of their postpartum experiences were aspects they felt unprepared for. Other issues are social and cultural barriers experienced while receiving prenatal care. Community members recall that there was little to no prenatal care information provided to them that was culturally relevant, including that there was a lack of informational materials offered in their native and first languages. Additionally, community members would often rely on family members to assist with translations when meeting with providers during appointments. Several community members also voiced how uncomfortable they felt having a male physician provide prenatal care and information to them. This was perceived as an important cultural barrier because in some Pacific Islander cultures, men are not allowed to be physically present and share intimate spaces with women. Several community members expressed that having a male physician provide prenatal care to them would discourage them from wanting to continue receiving prenatal care. Community members shared that there were several moments during their prenatal care appointments where healthcare providers would be culturally insensitive towards them. This included providers making discriminatory comments or remarks that were primarily based on false assumptions of Pacific Islander identities. Community members felt disrespected, frustrated, and uncared for, and also discouraged them from wanting to continue receiving prenatal care.

All children will receive acknowledgments at the end of the program where their goals are celebrated. Outcomes will be measured both quantitatively and qualitatively, by looking at the number of children who participate in the programs, and by listening to them talk about & write about their experiences as well as what they enjoyed most.

Community events will be promoted via social media, flyers and word of mouth. Participants attending will be given the ok and encouraged to post photos and videos of themselves double dutching.

The program introduces social justice awareness while cultivating positive self-identity as youth grow to realize their greatness while strengthening and contributing to their communities.

Trailblazers cultivates youth as they become empowered critical thinkers, driven by a deep sense of purpose. Trailblazers participants emerge as leaders as they explore the four pillars of: Personal Development, Social Justice, College, Career, and Entrepreneur Exploration, and Student-led Professional Development.

BRAVE believes youth voice is essential. Youth have the opportunity to explore methods for liberation from the harsh reality of systematic oppression. Youth learn communication skills for self-advocacy and gain a positive self-image. Youth engage in personal development practices that will increase academic performance, goal setting, and result in accomplishing personal and academic goals.  

Trailblazers' student-led, professional development sessions give educators the opportunity to hear from youth directly while engaging their own learning and reflection. Educators gain tools to develop a culturally responsive curriculum and instruction based on feedback from students of color. Educators learn how to improve culture and environment that is conducive to black and brown students—deconstructing systematic oppression that causes racial trauma.
